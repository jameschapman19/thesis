\chapter*{Impact Statement}

The theoretical contributions of this thesis will allow researchers to scale canonical correlation analysis methods to much larger datasets. This will be of huge benefit as access to large biomedical datasets becomes more readily available.
Through high quality open source implementations of a number of canonical correlation analysis methods, this thesis will also facilitate reproducible research and adoption by the Python community, which will be of huge benefit as the Python programming language is becoming the de facto standard for data science and machine learning.
Through this mechanism, work in this thesis has already had an impact in fields as diverse as process monitoring, geothermal flow, and medical imaging.

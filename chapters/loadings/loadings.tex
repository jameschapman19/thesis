\section*{Preface}

This chapter is based on observations made across a number of projects.
While the work itself is unpublished, it has influenced , most notably by the use of loadings rather than weights for model interpretation in \citet{} where I contributed parts of the appendix and encouraged the use of loadings for model interpretation. The simulated data generation methods were also used to generate simulated data in \citet{mihalik2022canonical}.
This chapter makes the theoretical case for using loadings rather than weights for model interpretation in \acrshort{cca} and \acrshort{pls} models.
It also presents a number of experiments demonstrating the relationship between loadings and weights in \acrshort{cca} models.


\section{Introduction}

In practical applications, (\acrshort{cca}) has two aspects: estimating latent variables associated with different views, and exploring the expression of these latent variables in each view, ideally providing insight into biomedical mechanisms.
This dual focus is similar to the distinction in machine learning between discriminative and generative approaches.

Discriminative approaches in Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) prioritize estimating latent variables from observed data, typically employing `weights' as parameters.
Conversely, generative approaches in CCA seek to understand the data generation process.
This perspective is illustrated by the `loadings' in our model, which represent the parameters transforming the latent variable into observed data.

\end{figure}

In this context, the generative or probabilistic CCA is parameterized by the \gls{loadings}, which play a crucial role in understanding how the latent variable (severity) influences the observed data (brain and behaviour).
On the other hand, the discriminative or machine learning approach to CCA is characterized by \gls{weights}, focusing on how observations can be used to estimate the latent variables.

The ideal CCA model aims to accurately estimate latent variables while maintaining the interpretability of the model, particularly through the loadings.
This allows for a deeper understanding of the relationship between different views (brain and behaviour) through the data generation process.
The significance of loadings for interpretability, particularly in the forward model, as opposed to weights in the backward model, was highlighted in the context of linear models like SVM and Lasso \citep{haufe2014interpretation}.
Our work in this chapter contributes to this discourse by demonstrating a similar interpretative advantage of loadings over weights in CCA models.

In this chapter, we reexamine the relationship between these discriminative and generative approaches to \acrshort{cca} approaches using simulated data.
We categorize the main simulated data generation methods for CCA into two groups: explicit latent variable models and implicit latent variable models; in particular by reformulating the joint covariance matrix perspective from \citet{suo2017sparse, chen2013sparse} as an implicit latent variable model.
With this context, we reconsider the role of regularization in \acrshort{cca} models and give recommendations for the use of loadings over weights for model interpretation.

\section{Unifying Generative Perspectives on \acrshort{cca}}\label{sec:generative-perspectives}

In this section, we review the generative perspectives on \acrshort{cca} and show that they can be categorized into two groups: explicit latent variable models and implicit latent variable models.

\subsection{Probabilistic \acrshort{cca} and \acrshort{gfa} (Explicit Latent Variable Models)}\label{subsubsec:a-probabilistic-latent-variable-perspective}

Let's reconsider the graphical model depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:forward-backward-models}.
Now we further assume that the brain is generated via a linear model with added noise, while the behavioural modality similarly arises from a linear model with noise.
Once again they are conditionally independent, given the latent variable.

The distributions of the two views are given by:

\begin{align}
    z& \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)\\
    x\sps{i} & \sim \mathcal{N}(W\sps{i} z + \mu\sps{i}, \Psi\sps{i})
\end{align}

Where \(z\) represents the latent variable (disease severity), \(x\sps{i}\) represents the $i^{\text{th}}$ view, \(W\sps{i}\) represents the model loadings, \(\mu\sps{i}\) represents the mean, and \(\Psi\sps{i}\) represents the noise covariance matrix for the $i^{\text{th}}$ view.
Notice that if it were not for the view-specific noise, the two views would be perfectly correlated subject to a linear transformation.

\citet{bach2005probabilistic} showed that the maximum likelihood solution for this model is equivalent to the solution of the \acrshort{cca} problem in the sense that the \gls{loadings} are the same as the \acrshort{cca} weights multiplied by the covariance:

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:probabilistic-cca}
    \hat{W}\sps{i} = \Sigma_{ii} \hat{U}\sps{i} R
\end{align}

Where $R$ is an arbitrary rotation matrix and $\hat{U}\sps{i}$ is the matrix of \acrshort{cca} weights for the $i$th view.
This implies that for invertible covariance matrices, we can access the `true' \acrshort{cca} weights associated with the top-k subspace by multiplying the \gls{loadings} by the inverse of the covariance matrix:

\begin{align}
    \hat{U}\sps{i}R = \Sigma_{ii}^{-1} \hat{W}\sps{i}
\end{align}

In practice we do not have access to the covariance matrices $\Sigma_{ii}$, so we must estimate them from the data using the sample covariance matrices $\hat{\Sigma}_{ii}$.

\textbf{Notice that for Identity covariance matrices, the \acrshort{cca} weights are the same as the loadings.}
Otherwise, there is a linear transformation between the two.
For singular covariance matrices, the \acrshort{cca} weights are not uniquely defined.

Moreover, the mean of the posterior distribution of the latent variables is proportional to the mean of the \acrshort{cca} scores \citep{klami2013bayesian}.
Group Factor Analysis (\acrshort{gfa}) is a closely related model that assumes diagonal covariance in $\Psi\sps{i}$:

\begin{align}
    z& \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)\\
    x\sps{i} & \sim \mathcal{N}(W\sps{i} z, \sigma\sps{i}I)
\end{align}

An interesting feature of the \acrshort{gfa} model is that as the noise level approaches zero, the marginal distribution of the views is the same as the probabilistic PCA model for each view~\citep{tipping1999probabilistic}.
This suggests that for small noise levels, we should in fact be able to recover much of the mutual information between the views by using PCA on each view separately.
For this reason, we will use and recommend PCA as a baseline in our later experiments.
Because the diagonal covariance assumption makes inference computationally cheaper, this line of work has been able to extend to incorporate sparsity on the loadings~\citep{virtanen2011bayesian} as well as missing data~\citep{ferreira2022hierarchical}.

By marginalizing out the latent variables of the generative \acrshort{cca} and \acrshort{gfa} models, we can write down the joint distribution of the two views:

\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        X\sps{1} \\ X\sps{2}
    \end{bmatrix} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \begin{bmatrix}
                                              \mu\sps{1} \\ \mu\sps{2}
    \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
                       W\sps{1}W\spsT{1} + \Psi_1 & W\sps{1}W\spsT{2} \\ W\sps{2}W\spsT{1} & W\sps{2}W\spsT{2} + \Psi_2
    \end{bmatrix} \right)
\end{align}

Importantly, this shows us that the true covariance in each view is a function of the \gls{loadings} and the noise covariance matrix.
Specifically, the covariance matrix of the $i^{\text{th}}$ view is given by:

\begin{align}
    \Sigma_{ii} = W\sps{i}W\spsT{i} + \Psi_i
\end{align}

While these generative models are provide a clear interpretation of the data generation process and possible biological processes, their application in practice is limited compared to classical \acrshort{cca}.
This is primarily due to their computational intensity and the need for a careful selection of priors.
Moreover, while these models can generate data with sparse loadings, generating data with sparse weights is challenging due to the dependence of \acrshort{cca} weights on the covariance matrices of the views.

\subsection{A Joint Covariance Matrix Perspective (Implicit Latent Variable Model)}\label{subsubsec:a-joint-covariance-matrix-perspective}

In contrast to the explicit latent variable models discussed earlier, the joint covariance matrix perspective offers an implicit approach to understanding the data generation process.
This method focuses on the covariance matrices of the views, rather than directly modeling latent variables.
A key advantage of this perspective, particularly noted in the sparse \acrshort{cca} literature, is its ability to generate data with sparse weights and or known canonical correlations.
This is achieved by constructing the joint covariance matrix of the two views as follows:

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:covariance}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        X\sps{1} \\ X\sps{2}
    \end{bmatrix} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \begin{bmatrix}
                                              0 \\ 0
    \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
                       \Sigma_{11} & \Sigma_{12} \\ \Sigma_{21} & \Sigma_{22}
    \end{bmatrix} \right)
\end{align}

Where $\Sigma_{11}$ and $\Sigma_{22}$ are the within-view covariance matrices and $\Sigma_{12}$ and $\Sigma_{21}$ are the between-view covariance matrices.

This has the advantage of allowing us to control the within-view covariance and therefore test the methods under specific conditions.
The process was first described by Chen~\citep{chen2013sparse} and further explained by~\citep{suo2017sparse} and has been the basis behind findings in \citet{helmer2020stability,matkovivc2023static}.

We can control the true signal by setting the active variables and correlations in the between-view covariance matrices $\Sigma_{12}$ and $\Sigma_{21}$.
Specifically we construct the between-view covariance matrices as follows:

\begin{align}
    \Sigma_{12}=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\rho_k\Sigma_{11}u\sps{1}_{k}u\spsT{2}_k\Sigma_{22}
\end{align}

Where $\rho_k$ is the $k^{\text{th}}$ canonical correlation and $u\sps{i}_k$ is the $k^{\text{th}}$ column of the matrix of weights $U\sps{i}$.

We can still access the true \gls{loadings} of the implied latent variable model by using the relationship in~\ref{eq:probabilistic-cca} and multiplying the weights $u\sps{i}$ by the within-view covariance matrix $\Sigma_{ii}$.

\section{A Mathematical Argument for Using Loadings not Weights for Interpretation of CCA Models}\label{sec:an-argument-for-the-use-of-loadings}

In this section, we make a mathematical argument for the use of \gls{loadings} over weights for the interpretation of \acrshort{cca} models.
In particular, we show that the \gls{loadings} are invariant to columnwise transformations of the data matrix, while the weights are not.

\acrshort{cca} can be solved in the principal component space. Consider the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrices:

\begin{align}
    X\sps{i} = U\sps{i}\Sigma\sps{i}V^{i\top} \label{eq:svd}
\end{align}

Here, $U\sps{i}$ and $V\sps{i}$ are the left and right singular vectors of $X\sps{i}$ respectively, and $\Sigma\sps{i}$ is a diagonal matrix of singular values.
The intuition behind this decomposition is that we are representing the data matrix in terms of its fundamental components: the directions of maximum variance (captured by $V\sps{i}$), the scale of these directions (captured by $\Sigma\sps{i}$), and the projections of the data onto these directions (captured by $U\sps{i}$).
$U\sps{i}$ are the principal components of $X\sps{i}$.

Substituting Equation \ref{eq:svd} into the \acrshort{cca} objective function, we have:

\begin{align}
    \max_{U\sps{1}, u\sps{2}} \Corr(X\sps{1}U\sps{1}, X\sps{2}u\sps{2}) &= \max_{U\sps{1}, u\sps{2}} \Corr(U\sps{1}\Sigma\sps{1}V^{1\top}U\sps{1}, U\sps{2}\Sigma\sps{2}V^{2\top}u\sps{2}) \label{eq:cca_obj}
\end{align}

Reparameterizing the weights as $v\sps{i} = \Sigma\sps{i}V^{i\top}u\sps{i}$, we obtain:

\begin{align}
    \max_{v\sps{1}, v\sps{2}} \Corr(U\sps{1}v\sps{1}, U\sps{2}v\sps{2}) \label{eq:reparam}
\end{align}

This reparameterization simplifies the optimization problem in two ways.
Firstly, if the data matrices are low rank (which is guarenteed if the number of samples is less than the number of features), then the matrix of principal components $U\sps{i}$ is lower dimensional than the data matrix $X\sps{i}$, reducing the number of parameters in the optimization problem.
Secondly, the reparameterization ensures that $v\spsT{1}U\spsT{1}U\sps{1}v\sps{1}=v\spsT{1}v\sps{1}$, making the constraints independent of the data.
We can therefore solve the CCA problem by solving the simpler PLS problem in the principal component space.
, which is computationally more feasible but also gives us a convenient way to understand how the weights and \gls{loadings} of \acrshort{cca} models change under different transformations of the data.

\textbf{Definition:} \textit{Loadings} are defined using the reparameterized weights as follows:

\begin{align}
    w\sps{i}_j = \Corr(X\sps{i}_j, U\sps{i}v\sps{i}) = \frac{\Cov(X\sps{i}_j, U\sps{i}v\sps{i})}{\sqrt{\Var(X\sps{i}_j)}\sqrt{\Var(U\sps{i}v\sps{i})}} \label{eq:loading_def}
\end{align}

By convention, and without loss of generality, we standardize the latent variables to have unit variance so that:

\begin{align}
    w\sps{i}_j = \frac{\Cov(X\sps{i}_j, U\sps{i}v\sps{i})}{\sqrt{\Var(X\sps{i}_j)}} \label{eq:standardized_loading}
\end{align}

Intuitively, \gls{loadings} measure how much each original feature contributes to the latent variables, providing insight into the structure of the data.

\subsubsection{Invariance to Scale}\label{subsubsec:invariance-to-scale}

First, we show that the \gls{loadings} are invariant to column-wise scaling of the data matrix whereas the weights are not.

\begin{lemma}
    Scaling the columns of the data matrix does not affect the left singular vectors $U\sps{i}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Scale the columns of the data with a matrix \( C \):

% LaTeX equation showing C as a diagonal matrix
    \begin{equation}
        C = \begin{pmatrix}
                c_{11} & 0      & \cdots & 0      \\
                0      & c_{22} & \cdots & 0      \\
                \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
                0      & 0      & \cdots & c_{nn}
        \end{pmatrix}
    \end{equation}

    where \( c_{ii} \) represents the scaling factor for the \( i \)-th column of the data matrix. For columns that are not scaled, \( c_{ii} = 1 \).
    This means that the corresponding column remains unchanged.

    Since $C$ is diagonal it can be represented by a diagonal matrix $S=C$ and an orthogonal matrix (the identity matrix) $R$.
    The transformed dataset is therefore \( X^{(1')} = X^{(1)}C \):

    \begin{align}
        X\sps{1'} = U\sps{i}\Sigma\sps{i}V^{i\top}C = U\sps{i}(\Sigma\sps{i} S\sps{i}) (\sps{i}V^{i\top}I) =  \label{eq:scaled_data}
    \end{align}

    which makes clear that the left and right singular vectors \( U\sps{i} \) and \( V\sps{i} \) right remain unchanged.
    Therefore, the modified equation can be represented as:
    \begin{equation}
        X\sps{1'} = U^i \Sigma\sps{i'} (V\sps{i})^T \label{eq:modified_svd}
    \end{equation}

    where $\Sigma\sps{i'}=\Sigma\sps{i} S\sps{i}$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Intuition}
Scaling the data is like changing the units of measurement.
It stretches or compresses the data but does not change the relationships between the samples.

Noting that the CCA optimisation problem remains the same as in Equation \ref{eq:reparam},
we can now show that the weights are not invariant to scaling of the data matrix but the \gls{loadings} are.

\paragraph{Weights change}

From the earlier reparameterization, and given that $v\sps{i'}=v\sps{i}$, the weights post-scaling are:

\begin{align}
    u\sps{i'} = V\sps{i}(\Sigma\sps{i'})^{-1}v\sps{i} = V\sps{i}(\Sigma\sps{i'})^{-1}v\sps{i} = C^{{(i)}^{-1}}u\sps{i} \label{eq:weights_change}
\end{align}

which are the original weights scaled by the inverse of the scaling matrix \( C \). This means that the weights are not invariant to scaling of the data matrix. Furthermore it means we can set the weights to arbitrary values by scaling the data matrix.
While we can build pipelines with standardized data, there is no a priori reason to do so.

\paragraph{Loadings are invariant}

Since \gls{loadings} are correlations between the original features and the latent variables, they are invariant to scaling of the data.
This follows from the definition of correlation and the unchanged latent variables:

\begin{align}
    w\sps{i}_j = \Corr(X\sps{i'}_j, U\sps{i}v\sps{i}) = \Corr(c_{jj}X\sps{i}_j, U\sps{i}v\sps{i}) = \Corr(X\sps{i}_j, U\sps{i}v\sps{i}) \label{eq:loading_invariant}
\end{align}

\paragraph{Intuition}
The \gls{loadings} remain the same because scaling the data does not change the relative contributions of each feature to the latent variables.

\subsubsection{Invariance to Repeated Linear Combinations of Columns}\label{subsubsec:invariance-to-linear-combinations}

We can also prove a more general result that the \gls{loadings} are invariant to repeated linear combinations of columns of the data matrix.
This is not as contrived as it sounds, since we often need to decide which features to include or exclude in a model, and when we work with highly correlated variables like survey questions, we may choose to use summary scores instead of individual questions.

\begin{lemma}
    Adding linear combinations of columns to the data matrix does not affect the left singular vectors $U\sps{i}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Now, consider adding columns that are linear combinations of existing columns in \( X\sps{i} \) to form \( X\sps{i''} \).
    We can represent this using a transformation matrix \( A \) such that \( X\sps{i''} = X\sps{i}A \):

%A is an identity matrix horizontally concatenated with another random matrix
    \begin{equation}
        A = \begin{pmatrix}
                1      & 0      & \cdots & 0      & a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1m} \\
                0      & 1      & \cdots & 0      & a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2m} \\
                \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
                0      & 0      & \cdots & 1      & a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \cdots & a_{nm}
        \end{pmatrix}
    \end{equation}

    where \( a_{ij} \) represents the weight of the \( j \)-th column in the \( i \)-th linear combination.
    The key is that we can still represent the transformed dataset as a product of the original left singular vectors \( U\sps{i} \) and a new diagonal matrix \( \Sigma\sps{i''} \) and right singular vectors \( V\sps{i''} \).

    \begin{align}
        X\sps{i''} = U\sps{i}(\Sigma\sps{i}V^{i\top}A) = U\sps{i}(\Sigma\sps{i'}V\spsT{i'})  \label{eq:svd_linear_combinations}
    \end{align}

    Where we know that the transformation is rank preserving because the first \( n \) columns of \( A \) are the identity matrix.
    The left singular vectors \( U\sps{i''} \) therefore remain the same as \( U\sps{i} \).
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Weights are Underdetermined}
The weights \( u\sps{i''} \) are underdetermined in the transformed space due to the added linear dependencies in the columns. The specific weights will depend on the SVD computation approach.

\begin{align}
    u\sps{i''} = V\sps{i}(\Sigma\sps{i''})^{-1}v\sps{i} \label{eq:weights_change}
\end{align}

\paragraph{Intuition}
In the extreme case, if we have two identical columns in the data matrix, then we can use any weights we like for these columns provided that their sum is the same.

\paragraph{Loadings Remain Invariant}
The loadings, as before, remain unchanged because the original columns are unchanged and the latent variables are unchanged.

\subsection{Summary}

We have shown that the \gls{loadings} are invariant to columnwise transformations of the data matrix, while the weights are not.
This is a key advantage of \gls{loadings} over weights for the interpretation of \acrshort{cca} models.
We might even be inclined to state this even more strongly: \textbf{the loadings are the true parameters of the model, while the weights are not}.


\section{Experiments}

Having given a mathematical argument for the use of \gls{loadings} over weights for the interpretation of \acrshort{cca} models, we now present a number of experiments demonstrating the relationship between loadings and weights in \acrshort{cca} models.

In this chapter, we use simulated data to illustrate properties of CCA models and then revisit the results of chapter~\ref{chap:als} to demonstrate the relationship between \gls{weights} and \gls{loadings} in real-world datasets.

\subsection{Simulated Data}

We used a number of simulated datasets, generated using the methods described in section~\ref{sec:generative-perspectives}.
Simulated data was characterized by distinct properties, including sparse weights and/or loadings.
In each dataset, both views have 10 features where 5 features are active and 5 features are inactive (in either a loadings or weights sense).
We used 50 training and 50 test samples for each of 10 independent random draws from the data generation process, as detailed in table~\ref{tab:simulated-data-parameters}.

\paragraph{Implicit Latent Variable Models and Sparse Weights:}
The implicit latent variable approach allows us to choose the true weights.
The true \gls{loadings} are defined as the product of the true weights and the true population within-view covariance matrices.
In line with the Joint Covariance method described in section~\ref{subsubsec:a-joint-covariance-matrix-perspective}, we generated data under two scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Using identity within-view covariance matrices, such that the true weights are equivalent to true loadings.
    \item Using random covariance matrices, where true weights differ from true loadings, usually resulting in non-sparse loadings.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Explicit Latent Variable Models and Sparse Loadings:}
The explicit latent variable approach allows us to choose the true \gls{loadings}.
The true weights were defined as the product of the true \gls{loadings} and the inverse of the true population within-view covariance matrices.
We generated data with sparse \gls{loadings} using the Probabilistic \acrshort{cca} and \acrshort{gfa} models, as outlined in section~\ref{subsubsec:a-probabilistic-latent-variable-perspective}.
The signal-to-noise ratio was set so that the sum of the signal's eigenvalues was twice that of the noise.

For each model, we estimated model \gls{loadings} using the product of the model weights and the sample within-view covariance matrix.
Note that because we multiply model weights by the sample covariance matrix to estimate the loadings, the estimated \gls{loadings} are sometimes not sparse even when both the model weights are sparse and the true covariance matrix is identity.

\newpage

Finally, we consider simulating data with the same scale as typical neuroimaging datasets.
We simulated data with 1000 samples and between 100 and 10,000 features.
We use an explicit latent variable model with non-sparse \gls{loadings} and vary the signal-to-noise ratio, defined by the ratio of the sum of the eigenvalues of the signal covariance matrix to the sum of the eigenvalues of the noise covariance matrix.

\section{Simulated Data Results}

\subsection{Implicit Latent Variables (Sparse Weights)}

\paragraph{Recovery of Weights and Loadings} Elastic regularization sets true zero weights close to zero and accurately retrieves true weights in both the identity (Figure~\ref{fig:joint-identity-weights-loadings}a) and non-identity (Figure~\ref{fig:joint-identity-weights-loadings}b) scenarios.
Unregularized \acrshort{cca} and Ridge \acrshort{cca} are comparable to Elastic Net regularization but slightly worse in both scenarios (Figure \ref{fig:joint-scores})
Figure~\ref{fig:joint-identity-weights-loadings}a highlights the disparity between \acrshort{pls} and \acrshort{rcca} compared to \acrshort{cca}.
In particular, it is clear that the \acrshort{pls} and \acrshort{spls} models have been skewed by the principal components.
Furthermore, the \acrshort{spls} does not result in appropriate shrinkage and identifies a number of false negatives.
This is perhaps suprising because all three problems are equivalent in the population setting (due to identical view covariances).
The models diverge in a sample setting because of non-identical sample covariance matrices, underscoring the distinction between population and sample settings and the interpretation complexities in the latter.
PCA performs well in the random covariance scenario, but poorly in the identity covariance scenario.
This suggests that the random covariance scenario results in a higher signal-to-noise ratio for these parameters.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Explicit Latent Variables (Sparse Weights)}

\paragraph{Recovery of Weights and Loadings} A striking observation, though theoretically consistent, from Figure~\ref{fig:latent-variable-weights-loadings}a is that PCA almost perfectly recovers the true \gls{weights} and loadings for the \acrshort{gfa} model with identity noise covariance.
Admittedly, we have chosen a reasonably high signal-to-noise ratio for this experiment, but this nonetheless demonstrates that PCA can be a useful baseline for multiview data under an isotropic latent variable noise model.
Indeed, in the identity noise covariance scenario, all the models perform similarly (Figure~\ref{fig:latent-variable-scores}a) with the exception of \acrshort{cca} which appears to be unstable in this setting (Figure~\ref{fig:latent-variable-weights-loadings}a).
In the random noise covariance scenario, PCA performs poorly, and \acrshort{cca} now performs well (Figure~\ref{fig:latent-variable-scores}b).
Figure~\ref{fig:latent-variable-weights-loadings}b indicates that with anisotropic noise covariance, PCA no longer captures the true loadings.
There is no strong evidence that \acrshort{spls} or Elastic Net regularization outperform \acrshort{pls} or \acrshort{rcca}, respectively, in this setting.
This is unsurprising because the true \gls{weights} are not sparse, and so the additional sparsity constraints do not help.
However, this does illustrate that priors on \gls{weights} do not translate well to priors on loadings.

\subsection{Measuring the Identitiness of the Covariance Matrices}
The theory we developed in section~\ref{subsec:generative-perspectives} suggests that the identitiness of the covariance matrices is crucial for understanding how imposing sparsity on the \gls{weights} imposes a prior belief in sparsity on the more biologically interesting loadings.
We can measure the identitiness of the covariance matrices by looking at the eigenvalues of the covariance matrices.
If the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix are all close to 1, then the sample covariance matrix is close to identity.
Departures from 1 indicate that the sample covariance matrix is not close to identity and imply multicollinearity in the data.

In the simulated data, we can see that the data generation models with identity noise covariance matrices, have eigenvalues closer to one than (Figure~\ref{fig:covariance-eigenvalues-simulated-low}).
On the other hand, these plots (shown for 10 random samples) show that all of the sample covariance matrices depart from the ideal case, \textit{even when the true covariance matrices are identity}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/covariance/simulated_covariance_eigenvalues_low}
    \caption{Eigenvalues of the covariance matrices for the simulated datasets.}\label{fig:covariance-eigenvalues-simulated-low}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Repeated Columns}\label{subsec:repeated-columns}

In this section, we explore the stability of \gls{weights} and \gls{loadings} in \acrshort{cca} models when faced with repeated columns in the data.
Our theoretical analysis suggests that while \gls{weights} may vary and are arbitrary with repeated columns, \gls{loadings}  remain consistent.

    \begin{subfigure}{0.49\linewidth}

        \caption{Identity Covariance Matrices}
    \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

Empirical results from our experiments validate this theoretical proposition.
We observed that in \acrshort{pls} and \acrshort{spls} models, which are significantly regularized (L2 regularization), the \gls{weights} for repeated features tend to be uniform.
However, in the case of \acrshort{cca} the \gls{weights} applied to repeated features are almost completely arbitrary (see the scale).
For Elastic and Ridge \acrshort{cca}, the \gls{weights} applied to repeated features, though not identical, display greater stability due to shrinkage effects.
In contrast, \gls{loadings} for repeated features remained consistent across all tested models, reinforcing our theoretical stance on their preferential use for model interpretation in scenarios with repeated columns or near-repeated columns.

\subsection{Brain-Behaviour Simulations}

We plot results for Ridge \acrshort{cca} and vary the regularization parameter from 0 (CCA) to 1 (PLS).

%\subsection{High-Dimensional Simulated Data}
%In this section we consider only the latent variable models in order to ensure we have a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to compare the models as we are deliberately undersampled.
%Figure~\ref{fig:latent-variable-weights-loadings-high}a once again shows that PCA is a useful baseline for multiview data under an isotropic noise model, even in the high-dimensional setting.
%On the other hand, \acrshort{cca} cannot recover any signal when it is overparameterized.
%Ridge \acrshort{cca} and \acrshort{pls} perform similarly, perhaps because the only identifiable signal is the \acrshort{pls} signal (since the \acrshort{cca} signal is not identifiable).
%Figure~\ref{fig:latent-variable-weights-loadings-high}b illustrates clearly that both \acrshort{rcca} and ElasticNet with their tunable L2 regularization both outperform \acrshort{pls} and \acrshort{spls} with fixed and maximal L2 regularization.
%It appears that in high dimensions correlated noise is a significant problem for \acrshort{pls} (and therefore \acrshort{spls}) when used as regularized \acrshort{cca} models, even though the models are identifiable.

\section{Revisiting Brain-Behaviour Results}

\subsection{Identitiness of Covariance Matrices}
In this section, we consider the identitiness of the covariance matrices for the \acrshort{hcp} and \acrshort{adni} datasets.
Figure \ref{fig:covariance-eigenvalues-real} shows the eigenvalues of the covariance matrices for the \acrshort{hcp} and \acrshort{adni} datasets while Figure \ref{fig:covariance-matrices-real} shows the covariance matrices themselves (with the \acrshort{adni} brain covariance matrix left out due to its size).
From Figure \ref{fig:covariance-eigenvalues-real}, we can see that the eigenvalues of the covariance matrices for the \acrshort{adni} data are much closer to the ideal for identity covariance than for the \acrshort{hcp} data.

\section{Discussion and Limitations}

In this section, we discuss the implications of our findings as well as the limitations of our study.

\subsection{Discussion}

\paragraph{Interpreting the Forward and Backward Models of \acrshort{cca}:} Consistent with \cite{haufe2014interpretation}, we have shown that assumptions imposed on the \gls{weights} of a model do not in general transfer to the loadings.
This is because the \gls{weights} and \gls{loadings} are only equivalent when the covariance matrices are identity.
We have gone a step further than \cite{haufe2014interpretation} by showing that the identitiness of the covariance matrices is crucial for understanding how imposing sparsity on the \gls{weights} imposes a prior belief in sparsity on the more biologically interesting loadings.

\paragraph{Sparsity on the \gls{weights} does not imply sparsity on the loadings:}

On the other hand, our results raise whether sparsity on the \gls{weights} makes sense in the first place.
For latent variable models of brain-behaviour associations, we have argued that the \gls{loadings} are the more biologically relevant quantity.
Since in practice, identity covariance is rarely a good assumption, the \gls{weights} and \gls{loadings} are not equivalent.
This means that sparsity on the \gls{weights} does not imply sparsity on the loadings, and so we should not expect sparsity on the \gls{weights} to lead to more interpretable loadings.
A practical step this implies is \textit{to ensure that the data covariances are at least close to identity before applying sparse \acrshort{cca} methods}.

\paragraph{Identitiness of real covariance matrices:} Between the \acrshort{hcp} and \acrshort{adni} datasets, only the \acrshort{adni} data had eigenvalue spectra that were reasonably close to those of an identity matrix.
This suggests that the only dataset and view where we can expect sparsity on the \gls{weights} to imply sparsity on the \gls{loadings} is the \acrshort{adni} data.
This is consistent with the results we have seen in the previous section, that sparsity improves performance in the \acrshort{adni} data but not in the \acrshort{hcp} data.
Furthermore, the \gls{loadings} and \gls{weights} are much more similar to each other in the \acrshort{adni} data than in the \acrshort{hcp} data, supporting the idea that the \acrshort{adni} \gls{weights} are themselves somewhat interpretable as estimates of the biologically relevant loadings.
Finally, in the well understood Alzheimer's disease data, we know that the identified \gls{weights} (and loadings) are consistent with the known biology of the disease.

\paragraph{Sample versus Population Setting:} The results from the simulated data illustrate the disparities that can arise between population and sample settings.
Although \acrshort{pls}, \acrshort{rcca}, and \acrshort{cca} are equivalent under isotropic noise in a population framework, experiments showed that their performance can vary substantially in a sample setting.
In particular, this manifested as \acrshort{pls} underperforming \acrshort{rcca} and \acrshort{cca} under isotropic noise \textit{even though this is exactly the scenario where covariance identity holds and covariance thus equals correlation}.
This is because the sample covariance matrix is not the same as the population covariance matrix and \acrshort{pls} is sensitive to even small differences in the principal components of the sample covariance matrix.
Furthermore, in limited sample sizes, our estimations of the covariance matrices are not accurate, and so the identitiness of the covariance matrices is not guaranteed.
This generally resulted in poor estimation of \gls{loadings} from model \gls{weights} \textit{even when the \gls{weights} themselves were estimated almost perfectly}.
Therefore, it's crucial for researchers to recognize these nuances and adopt appropriate measures when extrapolating results, especially in brain-behaviour studies where typically only one sample is available and often limited in size.


\paragraph{Can We Construct a Regularization Functional that Imposes Sparsity on the Loadings?}
Finally, given our observations, a natural question to ask is whether we can construct a regularization functional that imposes sparsity on the \gls{loadings} (instead of the weights).
The answer is yes, but it is not straightforward and in the small sample setting, it is not clear that it is a good idea.
The principle would be much the same as the Lasso, but we would need to use the sample covariance matrix to define the norm:

\begin{align}
    P(W)=\|W\|_1 \\
    P(L)=\|\hat{\Sigma}U\|_1

Which imposes an L1 penalty on the \gls{loadings} via an L1 penalty on the \gls{weights} multiplied by the sample covariance matrix.
We could in principle apply the soft-thresholding operator to the estimated loadings.
However we would need to be careful to ensure that the sample covariance matrix is invertible in order to get back to the weights.
This is of course not guaranteed in the small sample setting.

\section{Conclusion}

In this chapter, we have shown that the \gls{loadings} are of critical importance for the interpretation of \acrshort{cca} models.
We have shown that the \gls{loadings} are invariant to columnwise transformations of the data matrix, while the \gls{weights} are not.
Through a series of experiments, we have demonstrated that the \gls{loadings} are more stable than the \gls{weights} across datasets and samples.
We have also shown that regularisation of the \gls{weights} does not imply regularisation of the \gls{loadings}.
Finally, we have shown that the identitiness of the covariance matrices is crucial for understanding whether imposing sparsity on the \gls{weights} imposes a prior belief in sparsity on loadings.
We revisited the results of chapter~\ref{chap:frals} and showed that our interpretations would be different if we used \gls{loadings} instead of \gls{weights}.

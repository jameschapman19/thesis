\section{Introduction}

This chapter describes major software contributions made during the course of this thesis. In particular, this chapter describes the development of the \texttt{CCA-Zoo} Python package which provides a unified interface for canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and related methods. It also briefly describes \texttt{ProxTorch}, a Pytorch compatible package containing implementations of proximal operators for use in optimisation. Finally, it describes minor contributions to the \texttt{CCA/PLS Toolkit} for Multiview Analysis of Neuroimaging data in MATLAB.

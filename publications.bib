abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter focuses on the potential use of the NIPALS approach in the recent many-faceted development of path models in the social sciences. Three general types of models are considered, denoted L, L*, and L**, and are distinguished by which categories of the explanatory variables are directly or indirectly observed. The models have a background in two central lines of evolution in econometrics and the behavioral sciences. In another perspective of multivariate analysis, the models belong under two broad lines of evolution—from high degrees of information in the modelling to lower degrees of information. In the social sciences in the past, there has been a forceful development of causal model building by the use of path models. A new and most significant feature is that econometric methods have been incorporated in the modelling, a merger that brings together widely different lines of evolution and thereby opens up new vistas and broadens the scope of the approach. The chapter explores these developments from the point of view of NIPALS modelling. The chapter reviews causal flow models in econometrics and the behavioral sciences.}

	abstract = {In this book the authors present classical and recent results for matrix analysis that have proved to be important to applied mathematics. Facts about matrices, beyond those found in an elementary linear algebra course, are needed to understand virtually any area of mathematics, and the necessary material has only occurred sporadically in the literature and university curricula. As the interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and a reference work offering a broad selection of topics has become apparent, and this book aims to meet that need. This book will be welcomed as an undergraduate or graduate textbook for students studying matrix analysis. The authors assume a background in elementary linear algebra and knowledge of rudimentary analytical concepts. They begin with a review and discussion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The following chapters each treat a major topic in depth. This volume should be useful not only as a text, but also as a self-contained reference work to a variety of audiences in other scientific fields.},

Moreover, equality can only happen if the two matrices share a joint set of singular vectors, and this latter part is hard to find in the literature. We extend these facts to the separable Hilbert space setting, and provide a self-contained proof of the “latter part”.},

In particular, we show for all above problems (including asymmetric cases): 1) all local minima are also globally optimal; 2) no high-order saddle points exists. These results explain why simple algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent have global converge, and efficiently optimize these non-convex objective functions in practice. Our framework connects and simplifies the existing analyses on optimization landscapes for matrix sensing and symmetric matrix completion. The framework naturally leads to new results for asymmetric matrix completion and robust PCA.},

               attributable to common risk alleles. Here, in a two-stage
               genome-wide association study of up to 76,755 individuals with
               schizophrenia and 243,649 control individuals, we report common
               variant associations at 287 distinct genomic loci. Associations
               were concentrated in genes that are expressed in excitatory and
               inhibitory neurons of the central nervous system, but not in
               other tissues or cell types. Using fine-mapping and functional
               genomic data, we identify 120 genes (106 protein-coding) that
               are likely to underpin associations at some of these loci,
               including 16 genes with credible causal non-synonymous or
               untranslated region variation. We also implicate fundamental
               processes related to neuronal function, including synaptic
               organization, differentiation and transmission. Fine-mapped
               candidates were enriched for genes associated with rare
               disruptive coding variants in people with schizophrenia,
               including the glutamate receptor subunit GRIN2A and
               transcription factor SP4, and were also enriched for genes
               implicated by such variants in neurodevelopmental disorders. We
               identify biological processes relevant to schizophrenia
               pathophysiology; show convergence of common and rare variant
               associations in schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders;

               bipolar disorder cases and 371,549 controls of European
               ancestry, which identified 64 associated genomic loci. Bipolar

               disease with a lifetime risk of one in 350 people and an unmet

               29,612 patients with ALS and 122,656 controls, which identified
               15 risk loci. When combined with 8,953 individuals with
               whole-genome sequencing (6,538 patients, 2,415 controls) and a
               large cortex-derived expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in
               Parkinson's disease have increased the scope of biological
               knowledge about the disease over the past decade. We aimed to
               use the largest aggregate of GWAS data to identify novel risk
               loci and gain further insight into the causes of Parkinson's
               disease. METHODS: We did a meta-analysis of 17 datasets from
               Parkinson's disease GWAS available from European ancestry
               samples to nominate novel loci for disease risk. These datasets
               incorporated all available data. We then used these data to
               estimate heritable risk and develop predictive models of this
               heritability. We also used large gene expression and methylation
               resources to examine possible functional consequences as well as
               tissue, cell type, and biological pathway enrichments for the
               identified risk factors. Additionally, we examined shared
               genetic risk between Parkinson's disease and other phenotypes of
               interest via genetic correlations followed by Mendelian
               randomisation. FINDINGS: Between Oct 1, 2017, and Aug 9, 2018,
               we analysed 7·8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms in 37
               688 cases, 18 618 UK Biobank proxy-cases (ie, individuals who do
               not have Parkinson's disease but have a first degree relative
               that does), and 1·4 million controls. We identified 90
               independent genome-wide significant risk signals across 78
               genomic regions, including 38 novel independent risk signals in
               37 loci. These 90 variants explained 16-36\% of the heritable
               risk of Parkinson's disease depending on prevalence. Integrating
               methylation and expression data within a Mendelian randomisation
               framework identified putatively associated genes at 70 risk
               signals underlying GWAS loci for follow-up functional studies.
               Tissue-specific expression enrichment analyses suggested
               Parkinson's disease loci were heavily brain-enriched, with
               specific neuronal cell types being implicated from single cell
               data. We found significant genetic correlations with brain
               volumes (false discovery rate-adjusted p=0·0035 for intracranial
               volume, p=0·024 for putamen volume), smoking status (p=0·024),
               and educational attainment (p=0·038). Mendelian randomisation
               between cognitive performance and Parkinson's disease risk
               showed a robust association (p=8·00 $\times$ 10-7).
               INTERPRETATION: These data provide the most comprehensive survey
               of genetic risk within Parkinson's disease to date, to the best
               of our knowledge, by revealing many additional Parkinson's
               disease risk loci, providing a biological context for these risk
               factors, and showing that a considerable genetic component of
               this disease remains unidentified. These associations derived
               from European ancestry datasets will need to be followed-up with
               more diverse data. FUNDING: The National Institute on Aging at

               genes at these loci, with the majority in genetic generalized
               epilepsies. These genes have diverse biological functions,
               including coding for ion-channel subunits, transcription factors
               and a vitamin-B6 metabolism enzyme. Converging evidence shows
               that the common variants associated with epilepsy play a role in
               epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the brain. The
               results show an enrichment for monogenic epilepsy genes as well

               these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool

               approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of

The application of PRS has grown in recent years as their utility for detecting shared genetic aetiology among traits has become appreciated; PRS can also be used to establish the presence of a genetic signal in underpowered studies, to infer the genetic architecture of a trait, for screening in clinical trials, and can act as a biomarker for a phenotype. Here we present the first dedicated PRS software, PRSice (‘precise'), for calculating, applying, evaluating and plotting the results of PRS. PRSice can calculate PRS at a large number of thresholds (“high resolution”) to provide the best-fit PRS, as well as provide results calculated at broad P-value thresholds, can thin Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) according to linkage disequilibrium and P-value or use all SNPs, handles genotyped and imputed data, can calculate and incorporate ancestry-informative variables, and can apply PRS across multiple traits in a single run. We exemplify the use of PRSice via application to data on schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and smoking, illustrate the importance of identifying the best-fit PRS and estimate a P-value significance threshold for high-resolution PRS studies.Availability and implementation: PRSice is written in R, including wrappers for bash data management scripts and PLINK-1.9 to minimize computational time. PRSice runs as a command-line program with a variety of user-options, and is freely available for download from http://PRSice.infoContact:  jack.euesden@kcl.ac.uk or paul.oreilly@kcl.ac.ukSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

	abstract = {Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) are powerful multivariate methods for capturing associations across two modalities of data (e.g., brain and behaviour). However, when the sample size is similar or smaller than the number of variables in the data, CCA and PLS models may overfit, i.e., find spurious associations that generalise poorly to new data. Dimensionality reduction and regularized extensions of CCA and PLS have been proposed to address this problem, yet most studies using these approaches have some limitations. This work gives a theoretical and practical introduction into the most common CCA/PLS models and their regularized variants. We examine the limitations of standard CCA and PLS when the sample size is similar or smaller than the number of variables. We discuss how dimensionality reduction and regularization techniques address this problem and explain their main advantages and disadvantages. We highlight crucial aspects of the CCA/PLS analysis framework, including optimising the hyperparameters of the model and testing the identified associations for statistical significance. We apply the described CCA/PLS models to simulated data and real data from the Human Connectome Project and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (both of n{\textgreater}500). We use both low and high dimensionality versions of each data (i.e., ratios between sample size and variables in the range of ∼1-10 and ∼0.1-0.01) to demonstrate the impact of data dimensionality on the models. Finally, we summarize the key lessons of the tutorial.},

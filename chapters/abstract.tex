\chapter*{Abstract}

The integration of diverse health metrics poses a significant challenge in biomedical research. From subjective questionnaires to continuous biometric data, the need for effective methods to combine and analyze these disparate data sources is paramount. This thesis addresses this challenge by developing and applying novel machine learning methods, leveraging the power of self-supervised and multiview learning.

The primary contributions of this thesis are fourfold. First, a framework for regularised Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) using structured priors is developed, enhancing the interpretability of the results. Second, simulated data generation methods for CCA are unified under a latent variable model perspective, improving our understanding of the relationship between loadings and weights in CCA. Third, a new gradient descent approach for CCA and other generalised eigenvalue problems is formulated, tailored for large datasets. Finally, this gradient descent approach is extended to Deep CCA and Joint Embedding Self-Supervised Learning, enabling the integration of diverse data sources using modern deep learning techniques.

The practical implications of these contributions are significant. The regularised CCA framework allows for more accurate correlation of brain imaging data with behavioral assessments, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. The gradient descent approach enables efficient analysis of extensive health databases, such as the UK Biobank, leading to faster and more accurate health insights. The Deep CCA and Self-Supervised Learning extensions demonstrate state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets, illustrating their potential in integrating diverse data sources.

This thesis bridges the gap between the potential of biomedical data and the current capabilities of analytical methods, providing user-friendly methodological improvements that enable practitioners to focus on their domain expertise. By enhancing our ability to understand and manage personal health through the integration of diverse health metrics, this research paves the way for advancements in biomedical research and personalized healthcare.

\chapter{Flexible, Scalable Regularization for CCA}
\label{Regularised}
\minitoc
The content relating to regularised alternating least squares as a method for optimizing regularised CCA is based on an abstract which I presented in poster form at OHBM. The work benefitted from extensive theoretical discussions with John Shawe-Taylor and Janaina Mourao-Miranda as well as Janaina and Rick Adams' help interpreting the results.

    name={weights},
    description={
        The weights of a latent variable or representation are the coefficients in the linear combination of observed variables that constitute the factor.

\newglossaryentry{loadings} {
    name={loadings},
    description={
        The loadings of a latent variable or representation refer to the correlations between this latent variable or representation and the observed variables.
    },
}

\newglossaryentry{views} {
    name={views},
    description={
        Views are the observed variables in a multiview dataset, which can be of the same or different data types. The core assumption in multiview learning is that these views are interconnected. For instance, in a dataset comprising images and text describing the same object, or images of the same object from various angles, the different modalities are related as they depict the same subject.

\newglossaryentry{latent variables} {
    name={latent variables},
    description={
        Latent variables, also known as hidden variables, are unobserved variables used to model the relationships between observed variables.
    },
}

\newglossaryentry{representations} {
    name={representations},
    description={
        In a multiview dataset, representations are the latent variables that can be composed of various data types. Analogous to views, these representations are presumed to be interconnected within the context of multiview learning.

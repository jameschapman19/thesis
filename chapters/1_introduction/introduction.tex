\section{Setting the Stage: Biomedical Data and The Need for Effective Analytical Techniques}

The advent of modern technologies in biomedical research has led to an unprecedented surge in the quantity and complexity of data generated. From genomic sequences and proteomic profiles to neuroimaging and electronic health records, these multilayered datasets are a treasure trove of potential insights into disease processes and patient health. The ultimate goal of deciphering these intricate datasets is to enhance patient stratification processes, enabling a move towards personalised, precision healthcare. However, the analytical challenges posed by the scale, complexity, and heterogeneity of these datasets, coupled with the scarcity of labelled data, are significant.

In light of these challenges, this thesis proposes new methodologies based on unsupervised and self-supervised learning to extract meaningful information from these large, unlabelled, and complex biomedical datasets. It presents a specific focus on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), a widely used technique in the area of multi-view self-supervised learning (SSL), which, while powerful, comes with its own set of limitations when dealing with large-scale biomedical data.

\section{Problem Statement: The Need for Scalable, Flexible, and Interpretable Multiview SSL Methods}

Despite the advantages offered by multiview SSL methods in handling complex and high-dimensional biomedical data, the existing methodologies face substantial limitations, particularly concerning scalability, flexibility, and interpretability. The computational costs of traditional algorithms for solving CCA and other generalized eigenvalue problems are prohibitive when dealing with large-scale datasets. This limitation directly impacts their scalability and applicability to modern biomedical datasets. Moreover, the inherent inflexibility of traditional methods fails to capture the nonlinear relationships often present in biomedical data.

\section{Thesis Structure and Contributions}

This thesis is structured as follows:

In Chapter 2, we will provide an in-depth literature review on multiview learning and self-supervised learning techniques, establishing a foundational understanding of these methodologies in the context of biomedical data.

In Chapter 3, we propose a novel formulation for CCA, introducing an approach to solve it by gradient descent. This methodology allows for scalable solutions by enabling stochastic gradient descent, thus overcoming the limitations of traditional full-batch algorithms.

In Chapter 4, we introduce regularization via proximal gradient descent into our framework. This addition allows us to incorporate structured priors into our model, improving the interpretability of our findings, and enhancing their relevance to the biomedical context.

In subsequent chapters, we discuss the application and effectiveness of these methodologies, demonstrating their ability to handle large-scale datasets and the robustness of their results. We further present the possibility of extending these methods to deep learning when the sample size permits.

The main contributions of this thesis are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The introduction of a new formulation for CCA and generalized eigenvalue problems which can be solved via gradient descent, enabling the scaling of these methods to much larger datasets.
    \item The integration of regularization into the proposed framework using proximal gradient descent, enabling the inclusion of structured priors and improving the interpretability of the findings.
    \item Laying the groundwork for the potential incorporation of deep learning methods into the framework when the sample size permits, enabling the capture of non-linear associations in the data.
    \item 
\end{itemize}

Through these contributions, this thesis strives to bridge the gap between the potential of large-scale, complex biomedical data and the capabilities of existing analytical methodologies, bringing us one step closer to truly personalised medicine.

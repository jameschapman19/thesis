\section{MATLAB: PLS/CCA Toolkit}

This is a toolkit to incorporate standard and regularized PLS/CCA models to investigate multivariate associations between multiple modalities of data, e.g. brain imaging and behaviour or brain imaging and genetics. The toolkit includes various options for PLS/CCA models (e.g. PLS, CCA, PCA-CCA, SPLS, KCCA), statistical inference (descriptive or predictive), optimizing hyperparameters for regularized PLS/CCA as well as others (e.g. different deflation strategies).

\subsection{Features}

\begin{itemize}
    \item testing the generalizablity of the associative effects using mutiple holdouts
    \item testing the stability of models during regularization hyperparameter selection
    \item iterative calculation of associative effects, i.e. optimal regularization for each associative effect
\end{itemize}

For a discussion of the importance on pipeline choices, see Mihalik et al. 2020a.

\subsection{Contribution}

Wrote MATLAB code for the generation of simulated data with as described in chapter \ref{chap:framework}. This code is used in some of the examples in the documentation and is available to users to generate their own simulated data.

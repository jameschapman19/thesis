        The weights of a latent variable or score are the coefficients of the linear combination of the observed variables that make up the factor.

        The loadings of a latent variable or score are the correlations between the latent variable or score and the observed variables.

    description={
        Views are the observed variables in a multiview dataset.
        They can be either the same or different types of data.
        The key assumption of multiview learning is that the views are related to each other in some sense.
        For example, in a dataset of images and text, the images and text are related because they describe the same object.
        We could also have a dataset containing images of the same object taken from different angles, in which case the images are still related because they describe the same object.

    description={
        Latent variables are variables that are not observed.
        They are also called hidden variables.
        Latent variables are used to model the relationship between the observed variables.
